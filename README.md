# Pixi-Pan-and-Zoom

## What this is:
- A quick and somewhat clean example of how to implement pan and zoom in PixiJS
- A good place to build on these ideas and make the example better
- Built to aid in the migration from KineticJS to PixiJS at https://github.com/confile/Kinetic2Pixi

## What this is not:
- Not dependency managed.
- Not tested in a web server, runs locally fine.
- Not fully cross browser checked, I used the latest version Chrome and Firefox on Ubuntu 14.01
- Not tested on mobile. It probably doesn't work, but could pretty easily be expanded for touch devices.
